A grassroots motorcycle rally with an emphasis on off-road riding in eastern Kentucky's Red River Gorge canyon system.

## Resources
* Event Website: [redriverscramble.com](https://redriverscramble.com)
* GPX files obtained from a participant rider in the 2020 year event
* DBBB Full Route [GeoJSON](DBBB_full_route_tracks.geojson)

## Intentions
To develop an embedded interactive Mapbox map option for riders to view an event route.
Will pursue the option of being able to display Relief/Elevation Range. This style of interactive map would allow a rider to accurately visualize topographic impacts on the route.
