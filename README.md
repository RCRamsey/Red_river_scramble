## Resources
* Event Website: [redriverscramble.com](https://redriverscramble.com)
* GPX files obtained from a participant rider in this past years 2020 event

## Intentions
To develop an embedded interactive Mapbox map option for riders to view the events routes.
Would like to pursue the option of being able to display Relief/Elevation Range the way that the example given back in Module 9 showed (https://sheltoweetrace.com/hike/scenic/map/). This style of interactive map would allow a rider to grasp the skill/ability level necessary to select a route.
