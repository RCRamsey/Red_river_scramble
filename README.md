## Resources
*Event Website: [redriverscramble.com](https://redriverscramble.com)
*GPX files obtained from a participant rider in this past years 2020 event

## Intentions
To develop an embedded interactive Mapbox map option for riders to view the events routes.
Would like to pursue the route of being able to display Relief/Elevation Range the way that an example was given back in [Module 9] (https://sheltoweetrace.com/hike/scenic/map/). This style of interactive map would allow a rider to grasp the skill/ability level necessary to select a route.
