## Intentions
To develop an embedded interactive Mapbox map option for riders to view the events routes.
Would like to pursue the option of being able to display Relief/Elevation Range the way that the example given back in Module 9 showed (https://sheltoweetrace.com/hike/scenic/map/). This style of interactive map would allow a rider to accurately visualize topographic impacts on the routes in addition to grasp the skill/ability level necessary to accomplish it.
